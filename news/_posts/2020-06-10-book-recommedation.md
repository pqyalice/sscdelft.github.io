We are sure that most of you are engaging yourself in reading more. Here is a recommendation of a book that will put you in thoughts about our Universe:
**A Brief History of Time** by Stephan Hawking.

Stephan Hawking, a theoretical physicist, explains highly complex aspects of our physical universe in terms that can be understood by the most layman. The book was first published in 1988 and is a classic science book since then. Hawkings tries to touch upon several topics such as space and time, uncertainty principle, black holes, and many such concepts. The book also makes you think philosophically with its uncertainty principle. You would also experience Stephan hawking's scientific sense of humor along the way. 

If binge-watching 'Big Bang Theory' ever generated curiosity in you about understanding Sheldon, Here is a great chance for you ðŸ˜Ž

If you have any such book/movie that you want to share, please don't hesitate to let us know.

We hope you will enjoy the book and all stay healthy.
